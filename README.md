## What it shows

Three vertically-paged views on the Watch:

1. **Overview** — current PV power, today's panel-side production, today's
   grid export, per-battery state-of-charge chips, and a refresh button.
2. **Power 24h** — line chart of Solar / Consumption / Grid (net) over the
   last 24 hours, 15-min resolution; the Solar line is panel-side PV
   (AC-side Production + DC battery charge correction).
3. **Battery SoC 24h** — per-battery State-of-Charge over the last 24 hours.

Plus a watch-face **complication** (circular / inline / corner / rectangular)
showing instantaneous solar power; the rectangular family also lists per-stack
battery SoC.

Demo mode generates a synthetic 24h dataset for screenshots, demos, and
testing without an API key.

## API endpoints used

Per the SolarEdge Monitoring API spec (March 2026 revision):

| Endpoint                   | Purpose                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/sites/list`              | One-time site discovery from an Account key      |
| `/site/{id}/overview`      | Current power + today/lifetime energy            |
| `/site/{id}/powerDetails`  | 24h Production / Consumption / FeedIn / Purchased |
| `/site/{id}/storageData`   | 24h per-battery State-of-Charge + power          |

Authentication is by `api_key` query parameter on every call, exactly as the
spec mandates. The key is stored only in watchOS `UserDefaults` (App Group),
and is sent only as the query parameter in HTTPS calls to
`monitoringapi.solaredge.com`.

## Energy accounting notes (DC-coupled batteries)

SolarEdge Home Batteries are DC-coupled: PV energy that charges the battery
goes directly **DC→DC** through the battery management hardware and never
crosses the AC inverter. As a consequence the API's `/powerDetails.Production`
meter (AC-side) under-reports total PV by the amount of DC battery charging
and includes battery discharge through the inverter as if it were PV.

This app corrects for it per 15-min slot:

```
PV = AC_Production + battery_signed − grid_charge
```

- **`AC_Production`** — `/powerDetails.Production` (AC inverter output).
- **`battery_signed`** — combined battery power (`/storageData`): charging
  (positive) adds back the DC bypass; discharging (negative) cancels the
  battery's AC contribution so night-time battery output doesn't masquerade
  as solar.
- **`grid_charge`** — the grid-sourced part of charging, which is **not**
  solar (e.g. winter price-driven battery top-ups from the grid). It is
  detected from the reliable aggregate meters rather than the per-battery
  `ACGridCharging` field (which on multi-battery sites only the first
  battery populates, so it under-reports). The site is importing exactly
  when net grid = `Purchased − FeedIn` is positive, so:
  `grid_charge = clamp(net_grid_import, 0, battery_charge)` per slot.

Worked examples:
- Night, both batteries grid-charging: `AC≈0, batt=+2, import≈+2.2` →
  `grid_charge=2` → `PV = 0` ✓ (no sun)
- Midday PV charge while exporting: `import<0` → `grid_charge=0` → full PV
  credit ✓
- Discharge slot: `charge=0` → `grid_charge=0` → discharge still subtracted ✓

**Production Today** is the integral of this corrected per-slot PV since
midnight (each slot floored at ≥ 0). The NOW power and the complication apply
the same formula to the latest instant. All three track the SolarEdge portal
within sampling-resolution noise, including on days with grid charging.

**Exported Today** comes straight from `/powerDetails.FeedIn` (exact).
"Consumption Today" was originally shown but removed because the API's
Consumption meter under-reports relative to the portal by 1–2 kWh on
DC-coupled battery sites, with no formula derivable from the available API
meters that reproduces the portal's number. Showing FeedIn instead keeps the
displayed values exact.

**PV Lifetime** is not shown because the API's lifetime is AC-side and
therefore under-reports cumulative PV by the cumulative DC battery charge
over the site's life. The portal's lifetime can read several MWh higher.

## Rate-limit accounting

SolarEdge enforces **300 calls/day per account token**. Both the watch app's
refresh and the complication's `getTimeline` now fetch **3 endpoints**
(`overview` + `powerDetails` + `storageData`) — the complication needs
`powerDetails` for the net-import signal that drives the grid-charge
correction. To avoid double-spending the quota, the complication skips its
own fetch if the shared cache was updated within the last **12 minutes**
(`last_api_fetch` stamp), so the watch app's refreshes and the complication's
refreshes share one ~15-minute cadence rather than stacking. In normal use
this stays under the cap; to widen the margin, raise
`AppConfig.refreshInterval` in `SEAPIApp Watch App/Models.swift`.

## Requirements

- macOS Tahoe + Xcode 16+
- Apple Developer account (paid; free tier cannot install watchOS apps)
- A SolarEdge **Account-level API key**: Monitoring Portal → Account Admin →
  Company Details → API Access → Generate API key. (Site-level keys can't
  call `/sites/list` and aren't currently supported by the setup UI.)

## Generating the Xcode project

This repo uses [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen); the
`.xcodeproj` is not committed.

```bash
brew install xcodegen
cd SEAPIApp
xcodegen
open SEAPIApp.xcodeproj
```

## First-time configuration in Xcode

1. Select the project in the Xcode navigator and open the **Signing &
   Capabilities** tab for each target (`SEAPIApp Watch App`,
   `SEAPIComplication`).
2. Set your **Team** (Apple ID).
3. If Xcode complains the bundle IDs are taken, change the prefix
   `com.mtbsteve.semonitor` to a unique one across both targets, then update the
   matching **App Group** (`group.<your-prefix>`) and `keychain-access-group`
   in:
   - `project.yml`
   - `SEAPIApp Watch App/SEAPIApp.entitlements`
   - `SEAPIComplication/SEAPIComplication.entitlements`
   - `SEAPIApp Watch App/Models.swift` (`AppConfig.appGroupID`)
   - `SEAPIComplication/SEAPIComplication.swift` (top-of-file `appGroupID`)
   - Re-run `xcodegen`.
4. Confirm the **App Group** and **Keychain Sharing** capabilities are present
   on both targets and use the same group / access group.

## Running

1. Build & run the **SEAPIApp Watch App** scheme on your Apple Watch.
2. Paste your Account-level API key (dictation is easier than typing).
3. The app calls `/sites/list`, picks the first site, and starts displaying
   live data. Subsequent launches reuse the cached site ID.
4. Add the **SolarEdge Power** complication to a watch face (long-press face →
   Edit → Complications).

Demo mode: tap **Use Demo Data** on the setup screen for a synthetic dataset
that requires no API key and makes no network calls.

## Architecture

```
SEAPIApp Watch App/
  SEAPIApp.swift            — App entry, @main, environment
  ContentView.swift         — Root + SetupView + Loading/Error views
  OverviewView.swift        — Header card + Production/Exported stats + battery chips
  PowerChartView.swift      — Swift Charts 24h power chart (Solar corrected to panel-side)
  BatteryChartView.swift    — Swift Charts 24h per-battery SoC chart
  Store.swift               — @MainActor ObservableObject, auto-refresh, shared cache
  DemoData.swift            — Synthetic 24h dataset for demo mode
  SolarEdgeAPI.swift        — async/await client (api_key query auth)
  Models.swift              — Decodables + Snapshot/HistorySeries + AppConfig
  SEAPIApp.entitlements     — App Group + Keychain sharing
  PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
  Assets.xcassets/

SEAPIComplication/
  SEAPIComplication.swift   — WidgetKit complication (4 families)
  SEAPIComplication.entitlements
  PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
  Assets.xcassets/
  Info.plist
```

The Watch app and complication share an **App Group**
(`group.com.mtbsteve.semonitor`) for the cached snapshot, history, and the compact
values the complication reads.

## Security notes

- The API key grants full read access to your SolarEdge site(s). Treat it like
  a password.
- It is stored only in watchOS `UserDefaults` on this device. It is sent over
  HTTPS as a query parameter (per the SolarEdge spec).
- Never commit your key. `.gitignore` excludes `*.token` and `Secrets.xcconfig`.
- SolarEdge recommends rotating keys every 6 months.

## Known limitations

- Site-level API keys can't call `/sites/list`; the setup UI does not yet
  support manual site-ID entry. Use an Account-level key.
- Battery telemetries from some packs may have gaps; the chart skips missing
  samples.
- watchOS background-refresh budgets cap real-world cadence — the in-app
  15-minute timer applies only while the app is in the foreground or the
  complication is fetching its timeline.

```
SE Monitor puts your SolarEdge PV system on your wrist.

A standalone Apple Watch app that talks directly to the official SolarEdge
Monitoring API — no Home Assistant, no third-party servers, no iPhone
companion. Enter your SolarEdge Account-level API key once on the Watch and
SE Monitor shows:

• Current PV power (now), updated every 15 minutes
• Today's panel-side production (corrected for DC battery charging on sites
  with SolarEdge Home Batteries)
• Today's energy exported to the grid
• Per-battery State-of-Charge for each of your Home Battery stacks
• A 24-hour line chart of Solar / Consumption / Grid
• A 24-hour chart of battery State-of-Charge per battery
• A watch-face complication (circular, inline, corner, and rectangular
  families) with instantaneous solar power; the rectangular family also
  shows your battery SoC

All data flows directly between your Apple Watch and SolarEdge's servers —
nothing is sent to any other party. Your API key is stored only in watchOS
UserDefaults on this device.

Demo mode generates a synthetic 24-hour dataset for screenshots and demos
without an API key or any network access.

Requirements:
• A SolarEdge Account-level API key (Monitoring Portal → Account Admin →
  Company Details → API Access → Generate API key)
• An Apple Watch running watchOS 10 or later
